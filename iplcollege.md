      Previously, IPLC relied on Google Forms, emails, its Facebook page, and walk-ins to admit new students. While this approach got the job done, it lacked centralization and was inefficient. Managing data across multiple platforms was a hassle for the institute, and manually collecting and transferring information into spreadsheets was time-consuming and error-prone. To address this, I proposed centralizing the entire admissions process. The solution was to develop a dedicated admission system along with a student portal.

      The UI was designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, aiming to replicate the smooth experience of modern POS terminals. I focused on creating an intuitive, clean interface that minimizes user error and supports fast-paced environments like restaurants and caf√©s.
