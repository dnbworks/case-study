      Previously, IPLC relied on Google Forms, emails, its Facebook page, and walk-ins to admit new students. While this approach got the job done, it lacked centralization and was inefficient. Managing data across multiple platforms was a hassle for the institute, and manually collecting and transferring information into spreadsheets was time consuming and error prone. To address this, I proposed centralizing the entire admissions process. The solution was to develop a dedicated admission system along with a student portal.

      The UI design of the IPLC student portal was created with a strong focus on usability, clarity, and alignment with the school’s brand identity. I designed the portal using a step by step guided structure to make navigation intuitive and ensure students can easily complete tasks without confusion. The interface prioritizes simplicity and efficiency, reducing unnecessary elements while highlighting key actions and information. 
      
      In addition to the student portal, I also designed the marketing page to present information clearly and attractively for prospective students. The overall UI/UX was developed based on the school’s theme colors, incorporating a purple and blue palette to create a modern, professional, and cohesive visual experience.
